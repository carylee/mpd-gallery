Through the struggles our team was having dealing with brainstorming sessions, we began to brainstorm on what would make our team more productive. Through our own struggles we came up with a very elegant solution, ThinQ.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n<h3>Inception:</h3>\r\n<p>ThinQ knocks down the typical barriers of a brainstorming session. Addressing the issues of the Hippo in the room, insecurity, anonymity, group collaboration, and building on ideas were key to the concept of ThinQ. This is where the multiple handsets and one common interface came from. Also, we wanted to bring the nostalgia of Post-It note brainstorming into the modern era with an interactive software program.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n<h3>Implementation:</h3>\r\n<p>ThinQ brought together many different disciplines; software development, hardware, project management, and marketing. Leveraging our group’s strengths in these areas we were able to produce a product that spoke to the corporate and creative firms on the same level. They all saw the benefit to a glamorous and elegant way to increase their brainstorming productivity. Not only has this product impacted the productiveness of brainstorms in the largest corporations, but our group has used it to create even more fanciful products.</p><br/>',

			'description' => '<h3>Inspiration:</h3>\r\n<p>Early on in the program we began to look for opportunities of white space. The program taught us the proper methods for finding and honing in on white space. This concept began to be drawn out throughout the program. We gained inspiration from our ethnographic studies and real life experiences. The Baby No-Go was a no-brainer product once we got more in depth in our studies. Though we brainstormed many concepts we finally settled on the one that best combined the user insights, marketing surveys, and white space opportunities in the arena of baby care.</p><br/>\r\n<h3>Inception:</h3>\r\n<p>We began to develop the Baby No-Go with simple prototype parts. By getting the handson experience with the early prototypes it really helped to flush out our ideas. We used common household items; duct tape, cardboard, string, dog food, bananas, and even a hammer. The first idea is not usually the best but what is spawns leads to a wonderful concept. As the semester went on we began to see more and more opportunities for the Baby No-Go. We created a marketing plan that would get this product into stores like Toys-R-Us and Target. Positive feedback was given based on our 3D renderings and wewere able to make quick tweaks to our idea in 3D before moving into the final tooling phase.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n<h3>Implementation:</h3>\r\n<p>All our hard work paid off in the final version of Baby No-Go. This baby collar holds unwanted kids from jumping and climbing on guests. It is stylish and hits all the customer touch points of human factors, and unmet needs. Creating a blue ocean of new baby products geared toward keeping kids away promises to impact the social experiences of teachers, moms, dads, teenagers, and babies all across the world.</p>\r\n',

			'description' => '<h3>Inspiration:</h3>\r\n<p>Getting inspired is sometimes like a bolt of lightning. It can happen without warning.  As we embarked on a new concept for a well known brands we were all simultaneously struck by an unbelievable concept. We all had aging parents who had trouble at night with seeing, or in dark restaurants ordering their dinner. However, they were hip and cool parents who did not want to compromise their style for their convenience. This is where Revolution came about.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>Inception:</h3>\r\n<p>Revolution took some tinkering with. We needed to create the right style for babyboomers without looking too edgy or too old fashioned. In the same time we neededto match today’s latest technologies into our concept to make it work. By combininge-ink technology with high style and fashion we captured a huge market segment.Baby boomers with great fashion sense, a sense of transition without compromise, andthe ability to keep living your way even with poor eyesight, were all captured in ourpersonas. This is how Revolution was born.</p>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<h3>Implementation:</h3>\r\n<p>Getting Oakley to buy into our concept was the tough challenge. We had to provethat the technology would work. This was done with a very quick mock up prototype.Though we had a looks like in rendered form, our functions like prototype was likea helmet. Still, we fell that with a little more work, we can get all the componentsnecessary to fit into our glasses. This will change the way that people function and whoknows maybe you will be dancing the night away with your dad at the hottest club intown before you know it.</p>',
